      <p>
        This project RAID 2 by separating a text file into seven encoded text
        files. The seven files represent seven drives which would contain the
        encoded data. RAID 2 uses hamming codes to encode and decode. If one
        drive (text file) is corrupted, the program can still decode and
        reconstruct the original file.

      <h3>RAID 2</h3>
      <p>
        RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) is a class of I/O devices
        which have been used to improve disk performance and reliability. It was
        first proposed by D.A. Patterson in a
        <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~garth/RAIDpaper/Patterson88.pdf"
          >1988 paper</a
        >
        analyzing the performance of CPUs versus disks. "Inexpensive" was later
        renamed "independent." RAID implementations worked by distributing data
        across several drives. The seven standard RAID configurations are
        referred to today as RAID level 0 through RAID level 6.
      </p>
      <p>
        RAID 2 in particular uses the hamming (7, 4) code in order to split a
        byte into a pair of 4-bit nibbles. From here, each nibble is then
        encoded into a 7-bit code word, with parity bits 1, 2, and 4. Each drive
        then receives a single bit. The following image is from "Modern
        Operating Systems" by Andrew Tanenbaum and Herbert Bos.

      <h3>Hamming Codes</h3>
      <p>
        One of the best explanations of hamming codes I have ever seen is Grant
        Sanderson's video
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8jsijhllIA">here</a>. The
        basic idea is that we can encode a message to tell us not only if an
        error occurred, but also where that error occurred. To do this, we take
        each of our four-bit nibbles and add three parity bits. 
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          Position: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7
          Bit:      P1 P2 D1 P4 D2 D3 D4
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        The parity bits, P1, P2, and P4, are calculated by taking the
        exclusive-or for certain groups of non-parity bits.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          P1 = D1 XOR D2 XOR D4
          P2 = D1 XOR D3 XOR D4
          P4 = D2 XOR D3 XOR D4
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        For example, encoding the number 6 would give us a hamming code of
        <code>1100110</code>. Each of these bits would then be placed in one of
        the seven drives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Encoding the message <code>0x61626364</code> would give us the
        following.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          1 1 0 0 1 1 0
          1 1 0 1 0 0 1
          1 1 0 0 1 1 0
          0 1 0 1 0 1 0
          1 1 0 0 1 1 0
          1 0 0 0 0 1 1
          1 1 0 0 1 1 0
          1 0 0 1 1 0 0
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Which means that the drives would contain the bytes
        <code>0xEF, 0xFA, 0x00, 0x51, 0xAB, 0xBE, 0x44</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Decoding a message involves taking the exclusive-or of original four
        bits along with their parity bits. The three bit number which results
        from this calculation will then show where the error occurred. If no
        error occured, the result will be zero.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          C1 = P1 XOR D1 XOR D2 XOR D4
          C2 = P2 XOR D1 XOR D2 XOR D4
          C4 = P4 XOR D2 XOR D3 XOR D4
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        If, for example, our bit 2 was flipped in our original example of 6, it
        would look like <code>1000110</code>. Doing the above operation would
        result in the following information.
      </p>
      <pre>
        1 XOR 0 XOR 1 XOR 0 = 0
        0 XOR 0 XOR 1 XOR 0 = 1
        0 XOR 1 XOR 1 XOR 0 = 0
      </pre>
      <p>
        Which tells us our error is at position <code>010</code>, which is
        binary for 2.
