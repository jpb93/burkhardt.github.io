      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This was an early attempt to write a program that could visualize
        comparison-based sorting algorithms. It supports three of the
        $\displaystyle{O(n^2)}$ sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort,
        and selection sort. It technically implements bogosort as well, which
        runs in $\displaystyle{O((n + 1)!)}$. To achieve this, click the reset
        button until the entire array is sorted. If you did not get the joke, click
        <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Sorting/Bogosort">here</a> 
        to read about the amazing bogosort.

      <h2>Details</h2>
      <p>
        This was one of the first JavaScript projects I worked on when I was
        learning it for the first time. Everything was naively placed in a
        single index.html file, and I have chose to keep it that way as a
        reminder of those days.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was inspired by many of the sorting algorithm videos found on YouTube,
        such as
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg"
          >this one (seizure warning)</a
        >. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your perspective), my
        project does not make any noise.

        The implementation uses the HTML canvas API to draw rectangles on the
        screen based upon randomly shuffled values of an array. The sort
        functions then call an update function which re-draws the canvas every
        time an element is swapped. By making the functions async, I was able to change the rate
        at which the swaps occurred. The user can see this by changing the "Sort Speed" slider.
